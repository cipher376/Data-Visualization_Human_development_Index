# Data-Visualization_Human_development_Index

Final project: Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Introduction
In this final project, you will design four visualizations techniques for a challenging dataset
and provide a rigorous rationale for your design choices.
2. Tasks
The dataset is about the Human Development report in 2015. In fact, there are six main factors
for the Human Development that play an important role to distinguish among first world
countries, countries under development and third world countries. These factors include gender
development, gender inequality, historical index, human development, inequality adjusted, and
multidimensional poverty. The dataset is composed of six files where each one of them
represent a factor. In addition, a technical report is available for further explanation.

Step 1. Choose only two files that you prefer to study and pose two initial questions that
you would like to answer as you did in the assignment 2 and in the assignment 3. You have
the right to merge the two files in a one file. However, you need to justify any preprocessing
of your dataset.

Step 2. Assess the fitness of the data for answering your question.
Inspect the data--it is invariably helpful to first look at the raw values. Does the data seem
appropriate for answering your question? If not, you may need to start the process over. If
so, does the data need to be reformatted or cleaned prior to analysis? Perform any steps
necessary to get the data into shape prior to visual analysis.

Step 3. Design four visualization techniques that you believe effectively communicates the
data and provide a short write-up (no more than 4 paragraphs) describing your design. This
design must be implemented in Python. Illustration with interactive visualization library
Plotly and the design of multidimensional visualization technique will be an asset. While
you must use the data set given, note that you are free to transform the data as you see fit.2
Your chart image should be interpretable without recourse to your short write-up. Do not
forget to include title, axis labels or legends as needed!
As different visualizations can emphasize different aspects of a data set, you should
document what aspects of the data you are attempting to communicate effectively. In short,
what story (or stories) are you trying to tell? Just as important, also note which aspects of
the data might be obscured or down-played due to your visualization design. In your writeup, you should provide a rigorous rationale for your design decisions. Document the visual
encodings you used and why they are appropriate for the data. These decisions include the
choice of visualization type, size, color, scale, and other visual elements, as well as the use
of sorting or other data transformations
